#AquaticSpeciesList.xlsx#
 This includes a list of the indicator species for each ecoregion in North Carolina. These indicator species were selected in consultation with the NC DEQ, specifically Bryn Tracy. 
 
 This worksheet is used to select specific species to model based on the ecoregion in which the project occurs. 
 
 
 
#HUC12Lookup.csv#
 This file lists of all the NHD+ catchments in the 3 hydro regions (03N, 05, 06) along with their associated NHD GRIDCODE, FEATUREID, HUC_8, and HUC12. This file was created by spatially joining NHD+ flowline features with NHD+ catchments and HUC datasets. 
 
 This table is used as a lookup table in joining various in-stream and up-slope catchment variables. 
 
 
 
#SpeciesOccurrences.csv#
 This file lists all of the NHD+ catchments in North Carolina along with indications of whether a given aquatic species occurs in it. These data are derived from Mark Endries/USFWS dataset of species occurrences in NHD+ flowline segments across North Carolina.
